## Week 1
###Task 1.  
The theme of my database is the soul, folk, alternative and blues artist Hozier. Hoxier became popular in 2013 after his overnight sensation 'Take me to church.' Although many people may have only of heard of him through this song, Hozier has many blues songs with lots of direct religious contextual meanings. The music in these songs also contains lots of blues and soul tones. He takes influence from older artists such as mavis staples. I decided to do my database on Hozier becuase I am very familiar with his songs that are not necessarily popular and I feel this will help me with tasts in weeks to come.
